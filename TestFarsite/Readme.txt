TestFarsite

Usage:
TestFarsite [commandfile]
Where:
        [commandfile] is the path to the command file.

The command file contains command lines for multiple Farsite runs, each run's command on a seperate line.
Each command expects six parameters, all required
[LCPName] [InputsFileName] [IgnitionFileName] [BarrierFileName] [outputDirPath] [outputsType]
Where:
        [LCPName] is the path to the Landscape File
        [InputsFileName] is the path to the FARSITE Inputs File (ASCII Format)
        [IgnitionFileName] is the path to the Ignition shape File
        [BarrierFileName] is the path to the Barrier shape File (0 if no barrier)
        [outputDirPath] is the path to the output files base name (no extension)
        [outputsType] is the file type for outputs (0 = both, 1 = ASCII grid, 2= GeoTIFF
        
Example Command File contents:
project.lcp July.input July10.shp 0 July10 1

Using complete paths to all files is encouraged.
So the above example could become:
C:\Data\project.lcp C:\Data\July.input C:\Data\July10.shp 0 C:\Data\July10 1

Multiple commands can be used in the command file, one command per line

e.g.
C:\Data\project.lcp C:\Data\July.input C:\Data\July10.shp 0 C:\Data\July10 1
C:\Data\project.lcp C:\Data\July.input C:\Data\July10.shp C:\Data\July09.shp C:\Data\July10 1

It is important to note that any path specified in the outputDirPath must exist, TestFarsite will not create directories.
TestFarsite attempts to create all outputs.
